              We report the results of the SAMPL9 host–guest blind challenge for predicting binding free energies. The challenge focused on macrocycles from pillar[
              n
              ]-arene and cyclodextrin host families, including WP6, and bCD and HbCD. A variety of methods were used by participants to submit binding free energy predictions. A machine learning approach based on molecular descriptors achieved the highest accuracy (RMSE of 2.04 kcal mol
              −1
              ) among the ranked methods in the WP6 dataset. Interestingly, predictions for WP6 obtained
              via
              docking tended to outperform all methods (RMSE of 1.70 kcal mol
              −1
              ), most of which are MD based and computationally more expensive. In general, methods applying force fields achieved better correlation with experiments for WP6 opposed to the machine learning and docking models. In the cyclodextrin-phenothiazine challenge, the ATM approach emerged as the top performing method with RMSE less than 1.86 kcal mol
              −1
              . Correlation metrics of ranked methods in this dataset were relatively poor compared to WP6. We also highlight several lessons learned to guide future work and help improve studies on the systems discussed. For example, WP6 may be present in other microstates other than its −12 state in the presence of certain guests. Machine learning approaches can be used to fine tune or help train force fields for certain chemistry (
              i.e.
              WP6-G4). Certain phenothiazines occupy distinct primary and secondary orientations, some of which were considered individually for accurate binding free energies. The accuracy of predictions from certain methods while starting from a single binding pose/orientation demonstrates the sensitivity of calculated binding free energies to the orientation, and in some cases the likely dominant orientation for the system. Computational and experimental results suggest that guest phenothiazine core traverses both the secondary and primary faces of the cyclodextrin hosts, a bulky cationic side chain will primarily occupy the primary face, and the phenothiazine core substituent resides at the larger secondary face.},

              The SAMPL series of challenges aim to focus the community on specific modeling challenges, while testing and hopefully driving progress of computational methods to help guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. In this study, we report on the results of the SAMPL8 host–guest blind challenge for predicting absolute binding affinities. SAMPL8 focused on two host–guest datasets, one involving the cucurbituril CB8 (with a series of common drugs of abuse) and another involving two different Gibb deep-cavity cavitands. The latter dataset involved a previously featured deep cavity cavitand (TEMOA) as well as a new variant (TEETOA), both binding to a series of relatively rigid fragment-like guests. Challenge participants employed a reasonably wide variety of methods, though many of these were based on molecular simulations, and predictive accuracy was mixed. As in some previous SAMPL iterations (SAMPL6 and SAMPL7), we found that one approach to achieve greater accuracy was to apply empirical corrections to the binding free energy predictions, taking advantage of prior data on binding to these hosts. Another approach which performed well was a hybrid MD-based approach with reweighting to a force matched QM potential. In the cavitand challenge, an alchemical method using the AMOEBA-polarizable force field achieved the best success with RMSE less than 1 kcal/mol, while another alchemical approach (
              ATM/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/HREM
              ) had RMSE less than 1.75 kcal/mol. The work discussed here also highlights several important lessons; for example, retrospective studies of reference calculations demonstrate the sensitivity of predicted binding free energies to ethyl group sampling and/or guest starting pose, providing guidance to help improve future studies on these systems.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the binding affinities of small organic molecules to biological macromolecules can greatly accelerate drug discovery by reducing the number of compounds that must be synthesized to realize desired potency and selectivity goals. Unfortunately, the process of assessing the accuracy of current computational approaches to affinity prediction against binding data to biological macromolecules is frustrated by several challenges, such as slow conformational dynamics, multiple titratable groups, and the lack of high-quality blinded datasets. Over the last several SAMPL blind challenge exercises, host– guest systems have emerged as a practical and effective way to circumvent these challenges in assessing the predictive performance of current-generation quantitative modeling tools, while still providing systems capable of possessing tight binding affinities. Here, we present an overview of the SAMPL6 host– guest binding affinity prediction challenge, which featured three supramolecular hosts: octa-acid (OA), the closely related tetra-endo-methyl-octa-acid (TEMOA), and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8), along with 21 small organic guest molecules. A total of 119 entries were received from ten participating groups employing a variety of methods that spanned from electronic structure and movable type calculations in implicit solvent to alchemical and potential of mean force strategies using empirical force fields with explicit solvent models. While empirical models tended to obtain better performance than first-principle methods, it was not possible to identify a single approach that consistently provided superior results across all host– guest systems and statistical metrics. Moreover, the accuracy of the methodologies generally displayed a substantial dependence on the system considered, emphasizing the need for host diversity in blind evaluations. Several entries exploited previous experimental measurements of similar host– guest systems in an effort to improve their physical-based predictions via some manner of rudimentary machine learning; while this strategy succeeded in reducing systematic errors, it did not correspond to an improvement in statistical correlation. Comparison to previous rounds of the host– guest binding free energy challenge highlights an overall improvement in the correlation obtained by the affinity predictions for OA and TEMOA systems, but a surprising lack of improvement regarding root mean square error over the past several challenge rounds. The data suggests that further refinement of force field parameters, as well as improved treatment of chemical effects (e.g., buffer salt conditions, protonation states), may be required to further enhance predictive accuracy.},

Unique to GC3 was the addition of a Stage 1b self-docking subchallenge, in which the protein coordinates from all of the cocrystal structures used in the cross-docking challenge were released, and participants were asked to predict the pose of CatS ligands using these newly released structures.

The dataset contained 102 IC50 values, spanning six orders of magnitude, and 36 high-resolution co-crystal structures with representatives of four major ligand classes. Strong global participation was evident, with 49 participants submitting 262 prediction submission packages in total. Procedurally, GC2 mimicked Grand Challenge 2015 (GC2015), with a Stage 1 subchallenge testing ligand pose prediction methods and ranking and scoring methods, and a Stage 2 subchallenge testing only ligand ranking and scoring methods after the release of all blinded co-crystal structures. Two smaller curated sets of 18 and 15 ligands were developed to test alchemical free energy methods. This overview summarizes all aspects of GC2, including the dataset details, challenge procedures, and participant results. We also consider implications for progress in the field, while highlighting methodological areas that merit continued development. Similar to GC2015, the outcome of GC2 underscores the pressing need for methods development in pose prediction, particularly for ligand scaffolds not currently represented in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), and in affinity ranking and scoring of bound ligands.},

	abstract = {Computational blind challenges offer critical, unbiased assessment opportunities to assess and accelerate scientific progress, as demonstrated by a breadth of breakthroughs over the last decade. We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.},

            Computational techniques can speed up the identification of hits and accelerate the development of candidate molecules for drug discovery. Among techniques for predicting relative binding affinities, the most consistently accurate is free energy perturbation (FEP), a class of rigorous physics-based methods. However, uncertainty remains about how accurate FEP is and can ever be. Here, we present what we believe to be the largest publicly available dataset of proteins and congeneric series of small molecules, and assess the accuracy of the leading FEP workflow. To ascertain the limit of achievable accuracy, we also survey the reproducibility of experimental relative affinity measurements. We find a wide variability in experimental accuracy and a correspondence between binding and functional assays. When careful preparation of protein and ligand structures is undertaken, FEP can achieve accuracy comparable to experimental reproducibility. Throughout, we highlight reliable protocols that can help maximize the accuracy of FEP in prospective studies.},

            Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities remains a cornerstone problem in drug discovery. While binding affinity is inherently dictated by the 3D structure and dynamics of protein-ligand complexes, current deep learning approaches are limited by the lack of high-quality experimental structures with annotated binding affinities. To address this limitation, we introduce the Struc-turally Augmented IC50 Repository (
            SAIR
            ), the largest publicly available dataset of protein-ligand 3D structures with associated activity data. The dataset com-prises 5, 244, 285 structures across 1, 048, 857 unique protein-ligand systems, cu-rated from the ChEMBL and BindingDB databases, which were then computa-tionally folded using the Boltz-1x model. We provide a comprehensive charac-terization of the dataset, including distributional statistics of proteins and ligands, and evaluate the structural fidelity of the folded complexes using PoseBusters. Our analysis reveals that approximately 3\% of structures exhibit physical anoma-lies, predominantly related to internal energy violations. As an initial demon-stration, we benchmark several binding affinity prediction methods, including empirical scoring functions (Vina, Vinardo), a 3D convolutional neural network (Onionnet-2), and a graph neural network (AEV-PLIG). While machine learning-based models consistently outperform traditional scoring function methods, nei-ther exhibit a high correlation with ground truth affinities, highlighting the need for models specifically fine-tuned to synthetic structure distributions. This work provides a foundation for developing and evaluating next-generation structure and binding-affinity prediction models and offers insights into the structural and phys-ical underpinnings of protein-ligand interactions.

              Machine learning offers great promise for fast and accurate binding affinity predictions. However, current models lack robust evaluation and fail on tasks encountered in (hit-to-) lead optimisation, such as ranking the binding affinity of a congeneric series of ligands, thereby limiting their application in drug discovery. Here, we address these issues by first introducing a novel attention-based graph neural network model called AEV-PLIG (atomic environment vector–protein ligand interaction graph). Second, we introduce a new and more realistic out-of-distribution test set called the OOD Test. We benchmark our model on this set, CASF-2016, and a test set used for free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, that not only highlights the competitive performance of AEV-PLIG, but provides a realistic assessment of machine learning models with rigorous physics-based approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate how leveraging augmented data (generated using template-based modelling or molecular docking) can significantly improve binding affinity prediction correlation and ranking on the FEP benchmark (weighted mean PCC and Kendall’s
              τ
              increases from 0.41 and 0.26 to 0.59 and 0.42). These strategies together are closing the performance gap with FEP calculations (FEP+ achieves weighted mean PCC and Kendall’s
              τ
              of 0.68 and 0.49 on the FEP benchmark) while being  {\textasciitilde}400,000 times faster.},

	abstract = {Prospective validation of methods for computing binding affinities can help assess their predictive power and thus set reasonable expectations for their performance in drug design applications. Supramolecular host– guest systems are excellent model systems for testing such affinity prediction methods, because their small size and limited conformational flexibility, relative to proteins, allows higher throughput and better numerical convergence. The SAMPL4 prediction challenge therefore included a series of host– guest systems, based on two hosts, cucurbit[7]uril and octa-acid. Binding affinities in aqueous solution were measured experimentally for a total of 23 guest molecules. Participants submitted 35 sets of computational predictions for these host– guest systems, based on methods ranging from simple docking, to extensive free energy simulations, to quantum mechanical calculations. Over half of the predictions provided better correlations with experiment than two simple null models, but most methods underperformed the null models in terms of root mean squared error and linear regression slope. Interestingly, the overall performance across all SAMPL4 submissions was similar to that for the prior SAMPL3 host– guest challenge, although the experimentalists took steps to simplify the current challenge. While some methods performed fairly consistently across both hosts, no single approach emerged as consistent top performer, and the nonsystematic nature of the various submissions made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions regarding the best choices of energy models or sampling algorithms. Salt effects emerged as an issue in the calculation of absolute binding affinities of cucurbit[7]uril-guest systems, but were not expected to affect the relative affinities significantly. Useful directions for future rounds of the challenge might involve encouraging participants to carry out some calculations that replicate each others' studies, and to systematically explore parameter options.},

Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization.},

Accurately predicting the relative binding free energy changes of modifications to ligands is especially valuable in the field of fragment-based drug design, since fragment screens tend to deliver initial hits of low binding affinity that require multiple rounds of synthesis to gain the requisite potency for a project. In this study, we show that a free energy perturbation protocol, FEP+, which was previously validated on drug-like lead compounds, is suitable for the calculation of relative binding strengths of fragment-sized compounds as well. We study several pharmaceutically relevant targets with a total of more than 90 fragments and find that the FEP+ methodology, which uses explicit solvent molecular dynamics and physics-based scoring with no parameters adjusted, can accurately predict relative fragment binding affinities. The calculations afford R2-values on average greater than 0.5 compared to experimental data and RMS errors of ca. 1.1 kcal/mol overall, demonstrating significant improvements over the docking and MM-GBSA methods tested in this work and indicating that FEP+ has the requisite predictive power to impact fragment-based affinity optimization projects.},

Macrocyclization has been recognized as an effective way to restrict the conformational space of acyclic small molecule inhibitors with the hope of improving potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability. Because of their relatively larger size as compared to typical small molecule drugs and the complexity of the structures, efficient sampling of the accessible macrocycle conformational space and accurate prediction of their binding affinities to their target protein receptors poses a great challenge of central importance in computational macrocycle drug design. In this article, we present a novel method for relative binding free energy calculations between macrocycles with different ring sizes and between the macrocycles and their corresponding acyclic counterparts. We have applied the method to seven pharmaceutically interesting data sets taken from recent drug discovery projects including 33 macrocyclic ligands covering a diverse chemical space. The predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with experimental data with an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.94 kcal/mol. This is to our knowledge the first time where the free energy of the macrocyclization of linear molecules has been directly calculated with rigorous physics-based free energy calculation methods, and we anticipate the outstanding accuracy demonstrated here across a broad range of target classes may have significant implications for macrocycle drug discovery.},

            Protein-ligand interactions (PLI) are foundational to small molecule drug design. With computational methods striving towards experimental accuracy, there is a critical demand for a well-curated and diverse PLI dataset. Existing datasets are often limited in size and diversity, and commonly used evaluation sets suffer from training information leakage, hindering the realistic assessment of method generalization capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we present PLIN-DER, the largest and most annotated dataset to date, comprising 449,383 PLI systems, each with over 500 annotations, similarity metrics at protein, pocket, interaction and ligand levels, and paired unbound (
            apo
            ) and predicted structures. We propose an approach to generate training and evaluation splits that minimizes task-specific leakage and maximizes test set quality, and compare the resulting performance of DiffDock when retrained with different kinds of splits.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen the development of numerous deep learning-based protein-ligand docking methods. They offer huge promise in terms of speed and accuracy. However, despite claims of state-of-the-art performance in terms of crystallographic root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), upon closer inspection, it has become apparent that they often produce physically implausible molecular structures. It is therefore not sufficient to evaluate these methods solely by RMSD to a native binding mode. It is vital, particularly for deep learning-based methods, that they are also evaluated on steric and energetic criteria. We present PoseBusters, a Python package that performs a series of standard quality checks using the well-established cheminformatics toolkit RDKit. Only methods that both pass these checks and predict native-like binding modes should be classed as having "state-of-the-art" performance. We use PoseBusters to compare five deep learning-based docking methods (DeepDock, DiffDock, EquiBind, TankBind, and Uni-Mol) and two well-established standard docking methods (AutoDock Vina and CCDC Gold) with and without an additional post-prediction energy minimisation step using a molecular mechanics force field. We show that both in terms of physical plausibility and the ability to generalise to examples that are distinct from the training data, no deep learning-based method yet outperforms classical docking tools. In addition, we find that molecular mechanics force fields contain docking-relevant physics missing from deep-learning methods. PoseBusters allows practitioners to assess docking and molecular generation methods and may inspire new inductive biases still required to improve deep learning-based methods, which will help drive the development of more accurate and more realistic predictions.},

            Deep learning has driven major breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, however the next critical advance is accurately predicting how proteins interact with other molecules, especially small molecule ligands, to enable real-world applications such as drug discovery and design. Recent deep learning all-atom methods have been built to address this challenge, but evaluating their performance on the prediction of protein-ligand complexes has been inconclusive due to the lack of relevant benchmarking datasets. Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of four leading all-atom cofolding deep learning methods using our newly introduced benchmark dataset Runs N’ Poses, which comprises 2,600 high-resolution protein-ligand systems released after the training cutoff used by these methods. We demonstrate that current co-folding approaches largely memorise ligand poses from their training data, hindering their use for
            de novo
            drug design. This limitation is especially pronounced for ligands that have only been seen binding in one pocket, whereas more promiscuous ligands such as cofactors show moderately improved performance. With this work and benchmark dataset, we aim to accelerate progress in the field by allowing for a more realistic assessment of the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions.},
